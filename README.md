### Info

Client is done with Next.js, i18n with next-intl. Styling is all custom, using Tailwind CSS.

The server is very basic, it just provides the weather for Modena and the API route to send an email (in order to contact me). It is done with Node.js and Express.

### Installation and usage

- Run `pnpm install` both on `client` and `server` directories, start frontend and backend server from root directory with `pnpm dev`.
- To build the client or server, run `pnpm build` (then run `pnpm start` to start) on the respective directory.
